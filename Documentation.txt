In the code there is two components, multi_choice and multi_choice2, done in two different ways. 
One way to use them is to take the whole folder with that component and import in different project or to test it in this one, just change name in html tag in app.component.html.
Components are drop down menu with multiple choice, click and choose one or more items.
